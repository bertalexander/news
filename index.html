        <p> The diversity report of  the Fall 2016 is here, and while growth was made, there is still much room for improvement. </P>

        <p>With exciting, diverse castings at Yeezy Season 3 and Zac Posen, things looked promising at the beginning of Fashion Month in New York. But alas, the momentum stalled when things carried on to Europe, with cities like Milan and London making little to no improvements in casting. </p>

        <p>Diversity on the Runway is a serious issue and it is great to see New York designers taking serious strides to change the make-up of the runways.</p>

        <p>For the full report, head over to The Fashion Spot.
